## About Me
My name is Avela, a software developer with a deep passion for user experience. I love transforming ideas into realityâ€”whether through words, Figma designs, or fully functional applications. I enjoy both design and research, and I value security in every project I work on. I am always eager to learn and improve, with a strong focus on design patterns, reusability, and clean, structured code.
